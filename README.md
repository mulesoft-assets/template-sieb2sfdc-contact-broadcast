# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize contacts from Siebel to Salesforce organization.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of broadcasting accounts from Siebel to Salesforce instance. Everytime there is a new contact or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in Siebel source instance and it will be responsible for updating the contact in the Salesforce.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). The batch job is divided in  *Process* and *On Complete* stages. 
The integration is triggered by a scheduler querying newest Siebel updates/creations matching a filter criteria and executing the batch job. During the *Process* stage, each Siebel contact will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching contact in the Salesforce. 
The last step of the *Process* stage will group the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce. Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will log statistics data into the console.

# Considerations <a name="considerations"/>

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**



## Salesforce Considerations <a name="salesforceconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding Salesforce, in order for this template to work.

In order to have this template working as expected, you should be aware of your own Salesforce field configuration.

### As destination of data

There are no particular considerations for this Anypoint Template regarding Salesforce as data destination.
## Siebel Considerations <a name="siebelconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding Siebel, in order for this template to work.

This Anypoint Template may be using date time/timestamp fields from the Siebel in order to do comparisons and take further actions.
While the template handles the time zone by sending all such fields in a neutral time zone, it can not find out on its on the time zone in which the Siebel instance is on.
It will be up to the user of this template to provide such information. To find out more about Siebel time zones please check the following [link](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B40099_02/books/Fundamentals/Fund_settingoptions3.html)


### As source of data

In order to make the siebel connector work smoothly you have to provide the correct version of the siebel jars (Siebel.jar, SiebelJI_enu.jar) that works with your Siebel installation.








# Run it! <a name="runit"/>
Simple steps to get Siebel to Salesforce Contact Broadcast running.


## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
In this section we detail the way you should run your Anypoint Template on your computer.


### Where to Download Mule Studio and Mule ESB
First thing to know if you are a newcomer to Mule is where to get the tools.

+ You can download Mule Studio from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio)
+ You can download Mule ESB from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)


### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance: 

+ Anypoint Studio Project from File System
+ Packaged mule application (.jar)

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).


### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`


### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**.


### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)


## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>
In order to use this Mule Anypoint Template you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables. Detail list with examples:
### Application configuration
**Common configuration**
		
+ page.size `100`
+ scheduler.frequency `30000`
+ scheduler.start.delay `0`		

**Salesforce Connector configuration**

+ sfdc.username `bob.dylan@sfdc`
+ sfdc.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`
	
**Oracle Siebel Connector configuration**

+ sieb.user `user`
+ sieb.password `secret`
+ sieb.server `server`
+ sieb.serverName `serverName`
+ sieb.objectManager `objectManager`
+ sieb.port `2321`

**Watermarking default last query timestamp in MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss**

+ watermark.default.expression `"05/19/2015 10:00:00"`


# API Calls <a name="apicalls"/>
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

*** 2 * X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Contacts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Contacts are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every scheduler cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 21 api calls will be made (20 + 1).
Please note, that for each contact for which there is not existing matching account, there is another API call to Salesforce.


# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by a batch job that will be responsible for creations/updates. The severeal message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:

1. Job execution is invoked from triggerFlow (endpoints.xml) everytime there is a new query executed asking for created/updated Contacts.
2. During the *Process* stage, each Siebel contact will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching contact in the Salesforce.
3. The last step of the *Process* stage will group the contacts and create/update them in Salesforce.
Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will logoutput statistics data into the console.



## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is file is conformed by a Flow containing the Scheduler that will periodically query Siebel for updated/created Contacts that meet the defined criteria in the query. And then executing the batch job process with the query results.



## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
This is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions. 
This file holds a [Choice Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Choice+Exception+Strategy) that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
